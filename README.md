This project is a _*"Path Visualizer"*_ between the entered points. This Web Application consists of two pages,
the first page welcomes you with an easy question, answering which takes you to the main playground of visualizing paths on the surface of Mars!

####Features Available
*Information & Tutorial tabs, to guide you around.
*Have fun visualizing a once start, multi-stops paths
*Varying speeds to visualize the path
*Generate a random maze, or create your own, by simply toggling and dragging on the play grid
*A range of algorithms, running at different optimal paces
        * Dijkstra's,A*,Weighted A* etc (weighted algorithms)
        * BFS,DFS (in the unweighted category)
        *Even Bidirectional searches for path, in Bidirectional Dijkstra, Bidirectional A*, Bidirectional BFS and more!
